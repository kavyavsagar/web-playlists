# Web Playlists
Web app has been created to manage the playlists that is implemented using Firebase. Users can register new accounts and create
playlists which can be authenticated with Firebase Authentication.

Firebase performed as the backend services of the application so that developers are not worried about the backend codes 
or APIS. It offers real-time data reads and writes, but also comes with a powerful and flexible security system that allows 
you to write secure client-only apps, without needing any server code.

They offers Javascript SDK or Nodejs SDK to add Firebase to your app. Here i am trying to build a basic web app with
NodeJs SDK which should be 2.x or higher version of the Firebase SDK.
